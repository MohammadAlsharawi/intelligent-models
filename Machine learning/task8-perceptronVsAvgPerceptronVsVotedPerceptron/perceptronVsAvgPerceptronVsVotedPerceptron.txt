Understanding Perceptron Variants

This document explains three Perceptron-based algorithms used for binary classification:

1. Standard Perceptron
2. Voted Perceptron
3. Average Perceptron

Each algorithm is a linear classifier that separates data into two classes using a hyperplane. They differ in how they update and use weight vectors during training and prediction.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Standard Perceptron

Description:
The original Perceptron algorithm introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It maintains a single weight vector and updates it when a sample is misclassified.

How It Works:
- Initialize weights to zero
- For each training sample:
    - If prediction is incorrect:
        w = w + y * x

Advantages:
- Simple and fast
- Requires minimal memory
- Works well on linearly separable data

Disadvantages:
- Fails if data is not linearly separable
- Sensitive to noise
- Final model depends on last updates

Use Cases:
- Educational purposes
- Quick baseline
- Clean, linearly separable datasets

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Voted Perceptron

Description:
Improves the standard version by storing multiple weight vectors and vote counts. Each vector votes during prediction.

How It Works:
- Maintain list of weight vectors and vote counts
- On misclassification:
    - Store current weight and vote count
    - Update weights
- During prediction:
    - Each stored vector votes
    - Final prediction is based on weighted majority

Advantages:
- More robust to noise
- Better generalization
- Captures training history

Disadvantages:
- Requires more memory
- Slower prediction
- More complex

Use Cases:
- Noisy datasets
- Higher accuracy needs
- Research and experimentation

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Average Perceptron

Description:
Simplifies Voted Perceptron by averaging all weight vectors seen during training. Improves generalization without storing multiple vectors.

How It Works:
- Initialize weights and cumulative sum
- For each sample:
    - Update weights if misclassified
    - Add current weights to cumulative sum
- Final model uses average of all weights

Advantages:
- More stable than standard Perceptron
- Less memory than Voted Perceptron
- Smooths noisy updates

Disadvantages:
- Assumes linear separability
- Slightly slower training
- Not suitable for multi-class without extension

Use Cases:
- Better generalization than standard Perceptron
- Limited memory environments
- Balanced trade-off between speed and accuracy

| Prediction Speed      | Fast                | Slower                | Fast                  |
| Generalization        | Moderate            | Strong                | Strong                |
| Implementation        | Simple              | Complex               | Moderate              |

When to Use Which?

- Use Standard Perceptron if:
    - You need a fast, simple baseline
    - Your data is clean and linearly separable

- Use Voted Perceptron if:
    - You want high accuracy and can afford more memory
    - Your data has noise or borderline cases

- Use Average Perceptron if:
    - You want better generalization than standard Perceptron
    - You want a balance between performance and simplicity
